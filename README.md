# DurPhys

## An iOS mobile application designed for first year physics students at Durham University

Based off the [Android sister app](https://github.com/Bacoknight/DurPhys) created by [Kay Tukendorf](https://github.com/Bacoknight).

This app is designed to work with iPhone 5S and above. iPads are not actively supported but the app should still be mostly functional on them.

### Current Progress:
- [x] Set up of underlying app structure.
- [x] Design of main menu.
- [x] Navigation Drawer
- [ ] Design Teaching Formats pages (almost done, just missing button links and colouring of background).
  
### Still to do:
- [ ] App login using https://timetable.dur.ac.uk to verify credentials.
- [ ] JS Injection of aforementioned credientials into PSP, Email and DUO pages.
- [ ] Scrape the physics staff page for use in Important Contacts.
- [ ] Scrape appropriate module information for use in Course Information.
- [ ] Set up mapbox (or similarly appropriate API).
